**Combined SQL & Power BI Project: Data Analysis and Visualization**

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of SQL Server and Power BI for data exploration, analysis, and visualization. SQL was utilized for quick analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) by executing various queries, while Power BI connected to the SQL Server database to import and fetch the analyzed data. The insights were visualized through interactive dashboards built in Power BI.

Workflow
Data Exploration with SQL:

Performed exploratory queries to understand and analyze the data.

Generated metrics such as total earnings, completed trips, average fare, and more.

Leveraged advanced SQL techniques like ranking, dense ranking, aggregations, and joins for detailed analysis.

Visualization with Power BI:

Imported the processed data from SQL Server.

Built visualizations to showcase the insights gained.

Designed an interactive dashboard to empower stakeholders with actionable insights.

SQL Queries Highlights
Here are some of the key metrics and insights derived through SQL:

Total Number of Distinct Trips: 2,161 trips.

Total Drivers: 30 drivers.

Total Earnings: â‚¹751,343.

Completed or Successful Trips: 983 trips.

Most Used Payment Method: Credit Card.

Top 5 Earning Drivers: [Extracted using dense rank].

Location Pairs with Highest Number of Trips: [Derived using dense rank].

Search Conversion Rates: Calculated rates between searches, quotes, bookings, and cancellations.

Advanced metrics included:

Search to Estimate Rate

Booking Cancellation Rate

Conversion Rate

Location-Based Analysis for Fares and Cancellations

Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard visualizes:

Total trips, drivers, and earnings.

Payment methods usage and distribution.

Driver performance metrics.

Trends in fares, distances, and trip duration.

Location-based trip analysis.

Interactive visuals allow users to filter by duration, payment method, location, and more.

Insights and Outcomes
This project highlights the seamless workflow between SQL and Power BI to create robust data analysis pipelines and visualizations. By combining SQL's analytical power with Power BI's storytelling capabilities, actionable insights were presented in a clear and impactful manner.
